# Research Utilities

Finax includes tools for studying information asymmetry in financial markets.

## Information Asymmetry Metrics
- `finax.research.asymmetry.probability_of_informed_trading` estimates the PIN metric.
- `finax.research.asymmetry.vpin` computes volume-synchronized PIN over rolling volume buckets.
- `finax.research.asymmetry.information_asymmetry_index` offers a simple spread-based proxy for market frictions.

These metrics help quantify trading behavior and can be combined with Finax modeling utilities for publication-grade analysis.
